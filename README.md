### CAPSTONE-PROJECT
# Optimizing Wi-Fi Coverage and Network Efficiency at City College of San Fernando, Pampanga

This repository contains the complete documentation and design assets for our capstone project titled **"Optimizing Wi-Fi Coverage and Network Efficiency at City College of San Fernando, Pampanga."** This project focuses on improving the existing wireless infrastructure by optimizing coverage, reducing connectivity issues, and enhancing overall network performance within the school premises.

## Project Overview

The current network at City College of San Fernando suffers from poor Wi-Fi coverage and inefficiencies that hinder both academic and administrative operations. This project proposes an enhanced network infrastructure designed to deliver reliable wireless access, better bandwidth utilization, and improved user experience for students and staff.

## Key Objectives

- To assess the current network coverage and identify weak spots within the campus.
- To propose a network design that enhances Wi-Fi coverage and ensures efficient bandwidth distribution.
- To implement a scalable network plan with improved security, manageability, and performance.
- To validate the proposed solution through expert evaluation and feedback.

## My Role

In this capstone project, I served as the **lead researcher and manuscript organizer**. My responsibilities included:

- **Documentation (Lead):** Oversaw the structure, writing, and final compilation of the manuscript.
- **Network Design (Contributor):** Helped in creating the optimized network layout and configuration plan.
- âš™**Testing & Analysis (Contributor):** Participated in expert consultation, evaluation data collection, and analysis to validate the efficiency of the proposed infrastructure.
